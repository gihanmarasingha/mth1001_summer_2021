  * Axioms, dihedral groups, permutation group, orders of groups and elements.
  * Subgroups, cyclic subgroups, cosets and Lagrange's theorem.
  * Isomorphisms, homomorphisms, Cayley's thoerem.
* Linear algebra
  * Linear independence, span for real vector spaces.
  * Bases. Complex vector spaces. Examples. Subspaces.
  * Linear maps. Matrices and linear maps.
  * Vector spaces with a finite baiss. Dimenson.
