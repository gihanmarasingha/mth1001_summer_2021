## Definition 1.1
A prime number is a natural number p > 1, which is divisible only
by the natural numbers 1 and p.

/-
## Definition 1.2
Let m, n ∈ ℤ.
Then n is divisible by m (m ∣ n) if there exists a ∈ ℤ such that n = ma.

## Theorem 1.7
If n : ℕ, with n > 1, then either n is prime, or is a product of a
(finite) sequence of primes.

/-
## Theorem 1.8
Let n have the prime factorisations
      n = p₁ × ... × p_r = q₁ × ... × q_s
Then every prime occurs equally often in both factorisations (and so r = s)
